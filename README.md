# RESTify-Phases


This repo contain all phases for the RESTify project.
- The first phase consisted on creating static pages. This was done using HTML, CSS and frameworks like bootstrap. 
- The second phase consisted on making the API. We used Django for our back-end and SQLite for the databases.
- The third phase consisted of putting everything. We used React for front-end and merged our back-end from phases two.
